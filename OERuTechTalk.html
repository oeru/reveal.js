Of course, institutions can also choose reuse the course materials by copying and pasting them into their desired form.</p>

This is particularly well suited to supporting "open boundary" courses. By registering, learners will be engaged with course-related instructional emails. These communications will be delivered through our learner engagement platform, Mautic, which will allow us to determine when learners act upon these emails. [CSF email screenshot]</p>

                            <p>For our partners, its an opportunity to experience and use tools that don't get aggressively marketed to you. The ones that work well for you are there for the taking. You can cherry pick the ones you like best, and with our assistance, adopt them into your institutions. Also, with open source tools, you benefit from economies of scale - these tools all have international user bases, but without being treated like a small fish in a big pond. Plus, each one you adopt will likely save you far more than your OERu membership fees. </p>
